# About SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language for interacting with relational databases. Key SQL capabilities:

CRUD operations - create, read, update, delete data
Joins - combine data from multiple tables
Aggregate functions - summations, counts, averages on data
Subqueries - nested queries for advanced operations
Stored procedures - reusable routines for logic
Window functions - analytics functions for rankings etc.
